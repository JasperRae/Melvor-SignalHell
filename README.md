# Description
Welcome to Signal Hell! This mod evolved a bit from what I planned to be a mod that just added a few funny weapons. 
As of right now, there are:

<ul>
	<li>4 new weapons - 2 melee and 1 of magic and ranged each.</li>
	<li>3 new dungeons of Legendary difficulty, meant to fill the gap between the Dragons Den and Volcanic Cave</li>
	<li>1 new rune, as well as 1 new attack spell</li>
	<li>4 new pets (though 1 is not yet implemented)</li>
	<li>1 new type of crossbow bolt</li>
</ul>

I plan on adding a few more weapons and spells in the future, and hopefully some armour sets.

I'm still working on balancing, and I'm wanting to add quite a bit more content as my time and energy allow. My priority right now is figuring out combat balance, as weapons and dungeons are both not where I want them to be. I also plan on editing the loot tables for the dungeon chests, as right now I'm still experimenting with drop rates.

All of the assets are drawn by me.
